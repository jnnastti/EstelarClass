<p align="justify"> &emsp; The <b>EstelarClass<b/> is a system that will serve for the <b><i>COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF MACHINE LEARNING METHODS FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF TRANSITING EXOPLANETS</i></b>.

<br/>

 &emsp; Using the K2, KEPLER, and TESS datasets from NASA (available at the end of this information), an <b><i>EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS</b></i> will be conducted.</p>

 <br/>

 &emsp; This project is being developed for the completion of the Computer Science course at UNESC with the assistance of Dr. Leandro Neckel ([@leandroneckel](https://github.com/leandroneckel)) and Dr. Andr√© Ruaro.

<h2>Justification:</h2>


<p align="justify">  &emsp; The evolution of artificial intelligence has driven the development of new computing paradigms inspired by the abilities and efficiency of the human brain. 
  This progression has allowed the creation of smarter systems, capable of making complex decisions, processing large amounts of data, and solving problems efficiently, 
  bringing with it the potential to transform various industries and optimize processes, including scientific research.</p>

<p align="justify">  &emsp; It is believed that noticeable advances in the capability of artificial intelligence systems can be observed. Instead of operating mechanically or deterministically, 
  AI software learns and evolves continuously, incorporating real-world experience into its decisions, resulting in an improvement in human performance and the expansion of individual capabilities.</p>

<p align="justify">  &emsp; From the discovery of new materials and drugs to the prediction of complex natural phenomena, Artificial Intelligence has demonstrated its potential to accelerate scientific progress. 
  With continuous evolution, its presence in science is expected to become even more vital, driving discoveries and contributing to the deeper understanding of the universe.</p>

<p align="justify">  &emsp; In this way, the comparative analysis of machine learning algorithms for the identification of transiting exoplanets can bring advantages by showcasing 
  significant advancements in the ability to discover and characterize new exoplanets with greater precision. It also helps determine which algorithms are more 
  accurate in classifying data related to these celestial bodies, optimizing the use of resources (making the process more efficient and scalable), 
  and contributing to the advancement of the field of astrophysics and the discovery of new worlds beyond the solar system.</p>
